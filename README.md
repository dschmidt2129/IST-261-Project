# IST-261-Project
Project Proposal: 
1. The project I want to work on is a music review application.

2. I want to work on this project because I like to listen to a lot of music, but I don’t see enough reviews on the music that are written by my peers, so I do not always go into a song thinking knowing if it is worth my time to listen to or not. Most of the time I am too busy to listen to the full song, so a music review application could be very useful in creating a long playlist without spending hours listening to songs in order to develop it.

3. To successfully complete the project, I will need to improve my Java skills in these areas: advanced data structures (maps, tables, trees, etc...), MVC programming, and class inheritance.

4. I will need to learn new Java skills in these areas: Swing GUI programming, small database design in Java application development, and using interfaces to incorporate all the features that I would like to provide.

5. I will have the following challenges to overcome in implementing my project using the MVC design pattern: I will need to keep my code organized so that I don’t get lost and confused on the task that I am attempting to complete, I need to gain a better understanding on how the controller interacts with both the model and the view, and gain a better understanding of the more useful tools that Swing graphics provide.

6. Explain whether and why you will use Swing or Fx to complete your project? How familiar are you with Swing and Fx? (Realize that if you use a GUI editor (e.g., the one in NetBeans for Swing or SceneBuilder for Fx) that you are own your own as far as help goes.): I will be using Swing graphics in this endeavor.  I do not have a very good understanding of how either Swing graphics or JavaFx work, but my understanding is a little bit better, in Swing, so I believe that understanding will help me out in using the more advanced tools to complete my project.

Project Requirements:

The project you choose

must have the approval of the instructor for your project idea at least a week before your first deliverable is due
must use Java JDK 8.2 or above and NetBeans 8.2 or above
must use the MVC design pattern in the first deliverable
must use, by the final deliverable, a Java class that implements either Map, Set, or Queue
cannot use a database unless you give the grader an easy way to duplicate your setup so he can run your program; "easy" is in the eyes of the grader
cannot require the grader to log in to any externally hosted site; for instance, if you use an external API that requires an API key, you must hard-code that key into your program
